senior-design
=============

A repository for work on my senior design project: a submarine with a camera.

Probably won't be very interesting until second semester, and will mostly contain documentation until then.

Repository Organization
=======================

Bobby will maintain this repository, and dictate its usage.

We'll keep master as good, working code.  Branch organization:
 - (name)-master -- each person's master branch
 - (name)-(feature) -- branch for each person working on a feature
 
Everyone has read/write access, so please keep with creating branches and merging branches on your own.

Once you have good working code, you can send a pull request to master.
